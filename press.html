<marquee class="scrollnews">The proliferation of delivery services like Amazon Prime, FreshDirect, and Blue Apron has made leaving the cozy confines of one's apartment increasingly unnecessary. Why drive all the way to the store and actually interact with fellow humans when the same tasks can be accomplished with just a few clicks? And though dining out remains a major expenditure for food-obsessed millennials, many a night out are being forfeited in favor of another "Seamless and chill" session.

Delivery still makes up a relatively tiny portion of overall restaurant business, as the Chicago Tribune noted recently, currently comprising just three percent of total restaurant transactions. But even in the face of an overall restaurant traffic slowdown, the delivery business is growing. As mobile food delivery apps like Seamless, UberEats, Caviar, and Postmates steadily expand their delivery zones and their customer bases, many restaurants are increasingly relying on delivery orders as a significant source of revenue — and they're having to adapt operations accordingly to keep up with demand.

For Souvla, an upscale fast-casual Greek concept with three locations across San Francisco, delivery has grown into one of the pillars of its business. When Souvla's first store opened back in 2014, delivery wasn't even a twinkle in owner Charles Bililies' eye. "Historically, San Francisco has never been much of a delivery town," he says. "Certainly not in the way that NYC is, where Seamless and Grubhub have been a way of life for the better part of a decade."</marquee>
